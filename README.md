Examples of my work


Node.js / Handlebars - hapi-js

Project requirements: Generate a form template based on array values from the API_OPS_CONFIG variable. Include extra Hapi server helper function for the comparison operator missing from core HAPI functions. Below is a part of the form that splits input types into three main categories: text, select option, and date. Form also includes Bootstrap classes, required, readonly, form-group, and form-control, to streamline field validation.

Javascript / jQuery - hapi-jq

Project requirements: Using the same form above, there are situations in which the select option value is not the value wanted passed back to the form action.js file. The data requirements given by the project lead developer include more than just the human readable text of a key:value pair. Using jQuery on the page I set up if statements for both the default selected option, when that option is changed by the user, and when there is more than 1 select option menu in the form.
